## About

This project is a job search web application, focusing on the humanitarian field. It was built with React and Redux and uses the ReliefWeb API to get the information. On the homepage, the user can see the most recent offers and can filter them by country. By clicking in one of the offers, they will be able to see detailed information about it, such as description, application information, and a link to the original offer.

This project is a Capstone from the React course in Microverse's curriculum. The original instructions can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Catalogue-of-Statistics-72446e7fa33c403a9b6a0bc1de5c6cf5)
